## Technology stack

This is a **single-page React application** that consists of three blocks. **SASS/SCSS** preprocessor was used for styling.

To improve server requests handling, the **axios** library was used. To enhance the user experience, the **react-toastify** library was added to display status messages and notify in case of errors, as well as the **react-loader-spinner** for creating a Loader component.

To improve the form handling, **formik** library was used, which provides internal validation for all fields and controls the states in the React component.

For ease of form validation, **yup** library was utilized in combination with formik, which is considered to be one of the most effective libraries for handling forms in a React application.

The combination of **formik and yup** is one of the best combinations for working with forms in a React application.

For hosting the application, **gh-pages** library was used and deployed on the GitHub hosting.
